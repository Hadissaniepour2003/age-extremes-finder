# Age Extremes Finder

This Python script takes five user-input ages and finds the highest, second-highest, lowest, and second-lowest values. It uses simple logic and comparisons without sorting.

Originally written to practice basic conditionals, lists, and number handling.

## How to Run

```bash
python age_extremes.py
Enter 5 ages:
23
45
12
60
33

Oldest: 60
Second oldest: 45
Youngest: 12
Second youngest: 23
